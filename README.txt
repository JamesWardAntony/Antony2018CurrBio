Collection Details:

These data include subjects from all three experiments in the paper, subjects from non-TMR control experiments, all analysis scrips (MATLAB and R) and real-time scripts (MATLAB), and plots that should be generated by the data. In the main experiment, we used Biosemi ActiveTwo with 64 electrodes to collect the data. In the control experiment, we used NeuroScan software with 21 electrodes. Both used an electrically shielded room. Shared data are preprocessed after down-sampling, filtering, and re-referencing. Sleep scores and 5-s epochs marked for rejection are included in each subject’s folder. Raw data are available upon request and simply omitted for the sake of size. 

Contents:
Overview: See PreprocessingOverview.key file for graphical overview of how all of the analysis scripts fit together. The data are from Experiment 1 (< 100), Experiment 2 (101-125), and Experiment 3 (>180), and control subjects from a non-TMR experiment. 

Behavioral: Behavioral data for Exp 1-3 are included in their respective [subject]>behav folders. Their specifications are outlined in the relevant behavioral data processing scripts. 

Preprocessed: The preprocessed sleep data are included in the main folder (‘sleepRejICARejInt.set’ for Exp 1-2, ‘sleepInt.set’ for Exp 3). Then the further processed data are within the [subject]>sleep folders, including
- sleep stages (‘stages.txt‘ and ‘[subject]stagesJWA.mat’)
- reject values for every 5 s throughout recording (‘reject.mat’)
- the time in bed file (‘TIB.set’), which is essentially ‘sleepRejICARejInt.set’ clipped to the latest 30-s epoch
- folders with data from continuous SOphase, quantized spindle detection scripts (Spindle_Detection_11_16_Molle), and quantized slow oscillations (SO_05_35)

Processed: .mat files within '2_23_2017' are processed by earlier files to speed up physiology analyses. See PreprocessingOverview.key and the associated scrips for more details. 

Realtime: Here we have OpenViBE files we used to set up our experiment. A full overview of how OpenViBE works is beyond this README, but once you become acquainted with this software, these files will make more intuitive sense. A sample subject is included for offline (data read-in) testing. The online file is ‘sample-sleep.xml’ and the offline file is ‘sample-sleep-readin.xml’. 

Exp files: The 'expfiles' folder contains files to run the experiment in the programming language, Presentation. Also contains all visual and auditory stimuli used in the experiment. 

RStuff: R code for running statistical analyses.
